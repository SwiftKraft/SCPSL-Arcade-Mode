# Content

This plugin provides more gameplay features for *SCP: Secret Laboratory*, designed to enhance replayability, strategy, fun-factor, and player skill through a mix of roguelike elements, perks, and class-specific upgrade systems. 

Human players can collect perks by picking up *glowing large coins on the floor*, gaining powerful passive effects—each with trade-offs to preserve balance. Dying will cause players to lose a random perk. This encourages smart play, team coordination, and creative loadouts.

SCP players gain experience for their team through kills, they will receive an opportunity to upgrade each time their team levels up. 
Each SCP has tailored upgrade paths that can dramatically change how they play—whether you're building an undead army as SCP-049 or becoming a lone powerhouse through synergistic abilities.
You can decide to get various low level paths, or focus on a singular path for more powerful effects.
